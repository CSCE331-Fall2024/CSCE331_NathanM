        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am studying at Texas A&M University - Galveston where I am expected to graduate in Decemeber of 2026.
            This semester, I am taking two CS courses, a buiness management course, and an atmosphere science course. My current CS Courses are CSCE-331 Foundation Software Engineering, and CSCE-313 Intro to Computer Systems</p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
           <p> My past working experience involves Martial Arts as a taekwondo instructor, working as a cashier at Academy, and working in the kitchen at Chick Fil A.</p>
           <h3>Martial Arts - Taekwondo Instructor</h3>
                <p>Although I have done martial arts for over ten years, I started this position in July of 2021, and had to in May of 2023 to pursue my computer science degree at A&M.</p>
                    <a href="https://iamfamilymartialarts.com/"> If you would like to learn more about my taekwondo school, click here</a>
                <p>As an instructor, I handled meetings with potential members and their parents, discussed financial plans and offers,
                facilitated martial arts classes to cater to individual needs, taught self-defense to all ages, and my personal favorite, coached
                students to win multiple national tournaments. What I learned from this job was how to manage time efficiently, I developed interpersonal skills, and I worked on the business side as well when talking to parents about payment plans. For the other two jobs, I learned how to work in teams</p>
        <h3>Coding Experience</h3>
                <h4>CSCE-221 Data Structures and Algorithms in C++</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Binary search tree</li>
                    <li>Dijkstras algorithm/Graphing algorithms</li>
                    <li>List/basic Queue</li>
                    <li>Priority Queue</li>

                <ul><li>Techniques to learn programming languages efficiently</li></ul>
        <h3>Fields of Interest</h3>
            <p>There are many different areas that I am interested in for computer science. However, I have not fully figured out the career path I would like to pursue.
                While doing many projects over the span of my class work, I discovered a love for game design with the Tetris project in CSCE314, and from this website project I loved learning how to make and design a website.
                When I started programming, I wanted to do web design so this class has given me a small glimpse at what it is like. I would like to look for a web design position as my first job out of college, and if I like it then I will stay.
                I hope by the end of my college career, I will have discovered exactly what career I want to pursue.
