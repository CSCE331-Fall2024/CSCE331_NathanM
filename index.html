                <div class="aboutMePar">            
                    <p>Howdy! My name is Nathan McCullough. I am a computer science major at Texas A&M University - Galveston.</p>
                    
                    <p>Only in the last few years have I been active with computer science and programming. 
                        So far I really enjoy the challenge of coding! Although this is my first major project, I want to keep learning as much as I can to better understand systems and work for a respectable company one day.</p>
                            
                    <p>My main goals for computer science are to graduate from Texas A&M with at least two internships completed so I will have the best chance at a career in this field right out of college.
                        Outside of CS and college I am a practitioner of 2 different martial arts, Taekwondo and Muay Thai. I spent over ten years competing across the US in Taekwondo, and within the last year I have been training in Muay Thai.
                        I also enjoy soccer, and almost any animal. Back home my family has eleven dogs, a cat, a turtle, many chickens, and dwarf goats.</p>
